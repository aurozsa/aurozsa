## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm a student of statistics with an emphasis on data science at Brigham Young University. 
Favorite video game quote: "What is better, to be born good or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?"
  - You get a cookie if you guess the video game without looking it up.
My dream is to be able to predict events to the point of people calling me the Sage of Statistics
